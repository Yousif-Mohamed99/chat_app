final _firebase = FirebaseAuth.instance;
_firebase.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
          email: _enteredEmail,
          password: _enteredPassword, )

// Behind the scene, this method from firebase SDK will send a HTTP request to firebase


try {
        _firebase.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
          email: _enteredEmail,
          password: _enteredPassword,
        ); // Behind the scene, this method from firebase SDK will send a HTTP request to firebase
      } on FirebaseAuthException catch (error) {
        
        Any code
      }

When using try {...} on ... catch , only exceptions of the provided type (FirebaseAuthException in this case ) will be caught & handled.


- We use firebase Authentication -> for make Signup and SignIn
- We use firebase Storage -> for storage image files.
- We use firebase Firestore database -> for store metadata like 
	( a path to the uploaded image that belongs to a user - username - chat messages )


Note:
- Firestore works with so called Collections. (Folders that contains data), 
  and Documents, which is the actual data entries.
- Document could have more nested collection.


- sets -> Tells which data will be stored in the document
- add -> automatically generated name (unique id )

Examples:

 await FirebaseFirestore.instance
            .collection('Users')
            .doc(userCredential.user!.uid)
            .set({'username': _enteredUsername, 'email': _enteredEmail});



await FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('chat').add({
      'text': enteredMessage,
      'createdAt': Timestamp.now(),
      'userId': user.uid,
      'username': userData.data()!['username'],
    });


- we might learn in the future how to make an authentication chatScreen to make a specific 
  ChatScreen for each two users.
